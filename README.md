# alexa-Yallah-InspireMe-Node.js
"Yallah Inspire Me" is an Alexa Skill using Node.js that provides inspirational verses from Quran. The user can save a verse for Alexa to replay as favorite in future sessions. Users can listen to the Arabic recitation of the verse and see the original Arabic text. Users can find out which chapter and verse number of the inspiration.

Skill is submitted for publishin on Alexa skill store - waiting for results. 

"lambda/index.js" is the main file to change.

# ToDO:
Find higher resolution images, current ones do not display well since they are very low resolution.

As a starter I suggest using [the Amazon Alexa Skill link](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs/develop-your-first-skill.html)

Few other installation reminders:

1 - I used Node.js and have Alexa stored the code.

2 - Install VS Code and ask-cli to be able to debug your code from your computer, worked great.

3 - You can test the code through Alexa simulator or download the Alexa App to your phone and test/debug your unpublished skill from your phone.

4 - Alexa app on the phone displayed cards ( include text/images ) much better than Alexa simulator.
